/// Starts a receiver loop on an SSL session.
///
/// - Note: This operation does not close the socket or free the SSL structure when an error occurs.
///
/// - Note: This operation can resume transfers after a timeout occurs. I.e. after a timeout the operation can be called again with the same parameter values as before. This can be used to implement -for example- progress tracking.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - ssl: The session to use.
///   - bufferSize: The size of the buffer that will be allocated for the data to be received.
///   - duration: The maximum duration of a single receive loop.
///   - receiver: The destination for the ReceiverProtocol method calls.
