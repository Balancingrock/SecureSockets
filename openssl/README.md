These are precompiled versions of OpenSSL.

Naming convention: <openssl-version>-<build-system>

### SecureSockets v1.1.1 and later

__v1_1_1g-macos_10_15__ for macOS 10.15 and later
__v1_1_1g-mint_19_03__ for Linux Mint 19.3

SecureSockets 1.1.1 and later use a different approach to adopting openSSL. It is no longer necessary to modify the openSSl sources, but instead use CopensslGlue to provide the glue code.

### SecureSockets v1.1.0 and earlier

__v1_1_0-macos_10_12__
